          <p>
            I grew up in Seguku, Wakiso District, Uganda and now find myself 
            as a junior at <strong><a href="https://www.ashesi.edu.gh">Ashesi University</a></strong> in Ghana, where I soak up nature 
            and culture while pursuing a degree in Computer Science as a <strong><a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/all/scholars/">MasterCard 
            Foundation Scholar</a></strong>. 
            My career interests lie at the nexus of software development
            engineering and information security. I am passionate about technology and youth
            empowerment. I am hardworking, eager to learn and easily adapt to different environments. 
            I have over three years working experience in technical support engineering where I 
            accumulated experience in hardware and software maintenance, computer networking, 
            technical writing and teamwork. Also, I have experience in <strong>Python, MySQL, HTML/CSS, 
            JavaScript, ReactJS</strong>, and am proficient in <strong>Microsoft Applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint 
            and Outlook)</strong>. Away from the computer screen, I am an avid reader, a music aficionado and 
            I am learning Spanish. 
            I am seeking opportunities in application development, application support engineering, 
            information technology, software development / software engineering, and technical program/product management.
